# Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing the Iris Dataset

## 📋 Project Overview
This project explores and visualizes the famous Iris dataset to understand data trends, distributions, and relationships between different flower features. This is part of an AI/ML internship program focusing on data analysis and visualization skills.

## 🎯 Objective
Learn how to load, inspect, and visualize a dataset to understand:
- Data structure and basic statistics
- Feature distributions and relationships
- Outlier detection
- Species classification patterns

## 📊 Dataset Information
- **Dataset**: Iris Dataset
- **Source**: Built-in dataset from scikit-learn library
- **Format**: CSV-like structure
- **Size**: 150 samples, 4 features, 3 species
- **Features**:
  - Sepal Length (cm)
  - Sepal Width (cm)
  - Petal Length (cm)
  - Petal Width (cm)
- **Target**: Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)
- **Link**: [Iris Dataset on UCI Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas` - Data manipulation and analysis
  - `matplotlib` - Basic plotting and visualization
  - `seaborn` - Statistical data visualization
  - `numpy` - Numerical computing
  - `scikit-learn` - Dataset loading

## 📈 Visualizations Created
1. **Scatter Plots**: Show relationships between different feature pairs
2. **Histograms**: Display value distributions for each feature
3. **Box Plots**: Identify outliers and show data spread by species
4. **Correlation Heatmap**: Show feature correlations
5. **Pair Plot**: Comprehensive view of all feature relationships

## 🔍 Key Findings
- **Dataset Quality**: Clean dataset with no missing values
- **Species Distribution**: Equal distribution (50 samples per species)
- **Feature Correlation**: Strong correlation between petal length and petal width (0.96)
- **Species Separation**: Petal measurements provide clear species discrimination
- **Outliers**: Minimal outliers detected, mainly in sepal width measurements

## 📊 Results Summary
- Successfully loaded and inspected the Iris dataset
- Created comprehensive visualizations showing species patterns
- Identified key features for species classification
- Detected minimal outliers in the dataset
- Generated insights about feature relationships and distributions

## 🎓 Skills Demonstrated
- Data loading and inspection using pandas
- Descriptive statistics and data exploration
- Data visualization with matplotlib and seaborn
- Outlier detection and analysis
